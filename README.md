# MemeMe
[iOS Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003) MemeMe

Project Overview
-----------
Students will create an app that enables a user to take a picture, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme. The user will be able to share the photo on Facebook and Twitter and also by SMS or email. Memes will appear in a tab view with two tabs: a table view and a collection view.

Why this project?
-----------
MemeMe covers many of the major UI components found in essentially every app. It combines them with the camera and social media activity view to create a fun and personal user experience.

What Will I learn?
-----------
  - Access the Camera and Photo Album using the [UIImagePickerController](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIImagePickerController_Class/)
  - Understand how Swift optionals, closures, collections, classes, structs and protocols are used in iOS apps
  - Create Actions and Outlets with extremely high proficiency
  - Use a [UIActivityViewController](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIActivityViewController_Class/) to share media with Facebook, Twitter, SMS, and Email
  - Describe the delegate pattern and give a full account of its importance and uses in iOS classes
  - Set up a navigation structure that creates an intuitive flow through the app
  - Build tables with datasources and delegates
  - Create custom table view cells
  - Implement user interfaces with tab views and collection views

Why is this project meaningful to my career?
-----------
  - Becoming comfortable using all of the key components of UIKit is an essential step in becoming an iOS developer.
  - Understanding UIKit allows a developer to make educated assumptions about the architecture of apps that they use.
  - Mastering UKit fundamentals frees a developer up to learn model-oriented skills like networking and persistence.
